var is function-scoped and has been around since the early days of JavaScript. let is block-scoped and was introduced in ES6, offering a more predictable scoping mechanism. const is also block-scoped and is used to declare constants that cannot be reassigned after initialization.

In JavaScript, every value has a boolean equivalent. This means it can either be evaluated as true (truthy value) or false (falsy value) when used in a boolean context. 
But what is a boolean context? It's a situation where a boolean value is expected. Examples include if statements, logical operators, and so on. When you use a non-boolean value in a boolean context, JavaScript will convert the value to its boolean equivalent.
In this article, you will learn about falsy values in JavaScript and how to check if a value is falsy. The article also covers some best practices to consider when checking the boolean equivalent of a value.
